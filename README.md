# CubeCracker

CubeCracker is a C++ project aimed at generating a portrayal of a Rubikâ€™s Cube using standard template libraries (STLs), while ensuring that the representation remains consistent regardless of turning. The project incorporates principles of group theory to make the data representation isomorphic to the structure of a cube and to ensure that transformations of the cube remain homomorphic, allowing for a bijective object design.
